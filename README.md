# 3DS-Titles-Database

Thank you for looking at my database

The `.cia` files included in this repository are system apps. You may try to use them if you would like.

`GameBoy Advance Virtual Console` `.code` files are just the original `.gba` file, therefore they will not be put here because this is an anti-piracy database.

# Thanks to:

@RedDuckss for [RedDuckss/3dsamesicons](https://github.com/RedDuckss/3dsgamesicons). I was using the icons from his repo. (He did not make them for just me)
